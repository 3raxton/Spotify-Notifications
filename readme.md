## Spotify Notifications

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/Spotify-Notifications.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/Spotify-Notifications)

Spotify Notifications does nothing more than display a notification when:

- A song goes from "paused" to "playing" _(optional)_
- A new song is played

## Building

Spotify Notifications uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) which in turn
requires Ruby and Ruby Gems.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/citruspi/Spotify-Notifications.git
$ cd Spotify-Notifications
$ git submodule update --init
$ open Spotify Notifications.xcworkspace
```
